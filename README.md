## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pasquale Buonomo, but people mess it up all the time, so you can either try your luck or call me **Pico**. I am a human, I have many interests, and I dislike being labeled after just one of them at a time. For the sake of introduction, I prefer describing myself as a marine biologist turned programmer.
